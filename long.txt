i would not eat them
i would not eat them anywhere.
i would not eat green eggs and ham.
i do not like them, sam-i-am.
would you? could you? in a car?
eat them! eat them! here they are.
i would not, could not, in a car.
you may like them. you will see. 
you may like them in a tree!
i would not, could not in a tree.
not in a car! you let me be.
